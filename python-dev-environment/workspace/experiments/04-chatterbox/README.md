## Temperature

The temperature parameter (0 to 1) controls the "randomness" of the generated text (by the model). 

- High temperature (0.8-0.9): More diverse responses, potentially strange or irrelevant. 
Low temperature (0.2-0.1): Predictable and consistent responses, but less variety. 

The choice of temperature depends on your needs: diverse but potentially odd outputs, or safe and predictable ones.

## Session state

Streamlit's `session_state` acts like a memory for your app. It lets you store and access data between different parts of your app.
