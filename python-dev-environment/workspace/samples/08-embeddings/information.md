# Bombine

Bombine, also called bombina, is a culinary specialty of the Ardèche region, as well as the nearby Gard Cévenol. There are almost as many recipes as there are villages. In some, bombine is made up of small cubes of potatoes, simmered in a casserole dish, accompanied by carrots, onions, black olives, pieces of bacon (or lamb, or veal shank...), all flavored with bay leaf. It is originally the poor man's dish.

## History

Bombine was on the menu of all Ardèche homes, especially in winter. Depending on the valleys, it was also called flèque or l'estoufaïre (because it was also cooked in a stew according to some recipes). The real recipe for bombine is a legend, because there are as many ways to prepare it or to add to it as there are households where it is eaten. This dish was traditionally cooked in the fireplace. It was only in the 1900s that it came out of the fireplace to be enthroned on the wood stove. It would simmer for hours on the stove. Without meat, this dish was called the "poor man's dish" and could be eaten on Fridays, a lean day.

## Preparation

Peel the potatoes and carrots.
Cut the potatoes into large cubes and the carrots into slices, the salted pork belly into small lardons.
Chop the onions.
In a lightly oiled cast iron casserole dish, put some of the onions and some of the lardons. Then a layer of potatoes, beef, pork foot, carrots, the rest of the onions and lardons. Finish with a layer of potatoes.
Add thyme, bay leaf, salt, pepper, and tamp down a little.
Pour in the wine and water to barely cover.
Put on the lid and cook in a medium oven for 3 to 3 1/2 hours.
Bombine ardéchoise is a complete dish that can be served with a salad, for example. Enjoy!
